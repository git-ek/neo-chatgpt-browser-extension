# Privacy Policy

Neo ChatGPT for Browser Extension is committed to protecting your privacy.

- **Data Storage:** This extension stores the minimum data required for functionality—such as API keys and user settings—in your browser's local storage. No data is stored on external servers.

- **API Key Handling:** To prevent casual exposure, API keys are obfuscated (Base64 encoded) before being saved to your browser's local storage. They are never transmitted to any server other than the official API endpoints you have configured.

- **Data Usage:** Your search queries and conversation history are used only within the browser to provide the core functionality of the extension. This data is not collected, logged, or shared.

- **No Tracking:** The extension does not include any advertising, tracking scripts, or marketing-related data collection.

- **User Control:** You have full control over your data and can clear your API keys and all stored settings from the extension's options page at any time.
